Privacy Policy for Pocket Resume
Last updated: January 2026
Pocket Resume is a Chrome extension designed to help users create, store, and view resumes directly within their browser.
Your privacy is important. This policy explains what data Pocket Resume collects and how it is used.

Information Collection
Pocket Resume does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.
Specifically:


No user accounts or sign-in are required


No backend or cloud database is used


No personal information is sent to third-party services


No analytics, tracking, or advertising tools are included


All resume content entered by the user is stored locally in the browser using Chrome’s built-in storage APIs.

Local Data Storage
Pocket Resume stores resume data only on your device. This data:


Remains entirely under your control


Is never transmitted outside your browser


Can be removed at any time by clearing the extension’s data or uninstalling the extension



Permissions
Pocket Resume requests only the permissions necessary for core functionality. These permissions are used exclusively to enable features within the extension and are not used to collect or share personal data.

Third-Party Services
Pocket Resume does not use third-party APIs, external servers, or remote code execution.

Data Security
Because Pocket Resume does not transmit or store data externally, your information is not exposed to external systems. Security is handled entirely by the Chrome browser environment.

Changes to This Policy
If the privacy policy changes, updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
